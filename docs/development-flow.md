# 🚀 **Development Flow.md**

### _Full Engineering Roadmap for the Secure Device Control System (Aligned With README v2)_

---

# 🧭 **0. Purpose of This Document**

This document defines **exactly how to build the system from scratch**, one phase at a time, in the correct order, with the correct boundaries, ensuring:

- No subsystem is built prematurely
- All cryptographic trust flows are enforced
- Cross-service interfaces remain consistent
- Minimal working skeletons are validated before adding complexity
- Every subsystem can be tested independently and end-to-end

This roadmap is the **master engineering plan** for the Secure Device Control System.

---

# 🏗️ **1. Project Setup (Phase 0)**

### _Goal: Initialize repositories, skeletons, CI, and documentation._

---

## **1.1 Create the monorepo**

```
secure-device-control/
│
├── quoodle-control-plane/
├── quoodle-gateway/
├── quoodle-agent-windows/
├── quoodle-kernel-guard/
├── quoodle-mobile-client/
├── quoodle-infra/
└── docs/
```

Use the skeleton structure from `skeleton for all repositories.md`.

---

## **1.2 Initialize each repository**

- Laravel: `laravel new quoodle-control-plane`
- FastAPI: create `pyproject.toml`, `app/main.py`, dependencies etc.
- WindowsAgent: initialize CMake project
- KernelService: C/C++ project with CMake
- Mobile app: `flutter create quoodle-mobile-client`
- Infrastructure: create Dockerfiles + k8s templates in `quoodle-infra`

---

## **1.3 Set up global GitHub Actions (CI)**

Enable CI workflows for:

- Laravel tests
- FastAPI tests
- Agent build (CMake)
- KernelService build
- Flutter build
- Linting
- Security scans (optional)

---

## **1.4 Populate docs folder**

Copy all JSON specs into:

```
docs/specs/
```

Create placeholders:

- `docs/architecture/overview.md`
- `docs/protocols/ws_protocol.md`
- `docs/security/threat_model.md`
- etc.
